## What it does

This plugin automatically creates Github repositories and NPM packages for individual functions you've defined in your own project, which are then actually published so other people can see your fantastic work. It also installs the newly created NPM packages to your local project and adds them to your dependencies for clean, concise, and beautiful code! Now everyone can use your artistically crafted code as hard dependencies in their own projects!

## Usage

1. Make a selection of ONE function definition and press Ctrl+Alt+n or right click and go to "Napalm -> Package".

2. With nothing selected, press Ctrl+Alt+n or right click and go to "Napalm -> Package". This will parse all function definitions in the current file.
